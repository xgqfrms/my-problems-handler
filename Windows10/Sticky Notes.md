# Sticky Notes: suggestion !

***  
windows 桌面便签,设计的太shit了，记了好多东西，不小心到删除的X,就一下全没了！
为什么：不把他设计的像删除其他文件一样：不是直接删除，而是放到垃圾桶呢！ 难道没有人遇到我的这种问题吗？ o(︶︿︶)o 唉

Windows desktop notes, the design is too shit!
I had noted a lot of things, but I deleted it by incaution ,all of things was gone! (without any reminder  or waring)
Why do not put it in the design of the same as delete other files?
 not directly delete, but put it in the Recycle Bin!
I wander whether anyone meet  this kind of problem? 
why not to modify the bug!
